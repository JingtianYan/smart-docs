Overview
========

SMART (Scalable Multi‑Agent Realistic Testbed) is a realistic and efficient
software tool for evaluating Multi‑Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. SMART
bridges the gap between MAPF research and real‑world application by combining
physics‑engine based simulation, an execution monitoring framework, and
scalable software design that supports large numbers of robots.

Key highlights
--------------

- Realistic simulation using physics engines to capture kinodynamics and
  execution uncertainty.
- Execution monitoring based on an Action Dependency Graph to integrate
  planners and robot models.
- Designed to scale to hundreds or thousands of agents for large experiments.
