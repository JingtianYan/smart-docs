Advancing MAPF towards the Real World: A Scalable Multi‑Agent Realistic
Testbed (SMART)

Summary
-------

The SMART testbed provides a realistic environment for evaluating Multi‑Agent
Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms. It couples physics‑engine based simulation to
better model kinodynamics and execution uncertainty, uses an Action Dependency
Graph for execution monitoring, and focuses on scaling to large numbers of
agents.
